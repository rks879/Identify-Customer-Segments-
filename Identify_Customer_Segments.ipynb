    "# Project: Identify Customer Segments\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you complete this task by providing a framework within which you will perform your analysis steps. In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. **Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks.** The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that while there will be precise guidelines on how you should handle certain tasks in the project, there will also be places where an exact specification is not provided. **There will be times in the project where you will need to make and justify your own decisions on how to treat the data.** These are places where there may not be only one way to handle the data. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of most sections, there will be a Markdown cell labeled **Discussion**. In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. **Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.**"

    "### Step 0: Load the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four files associated with this project (not including this one):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Data_Dictionary.md`: Detailed information file about the features in the provided datasets.\n",
    "- `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv`: Summary of feature attributes for demographics data; 85 features (rows) x 4 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. You will use this information to cluster the general population into groups with similar demographic properties. Then, you will see how the people in the customers dataset fit into those created clusters. The hope here is that certain clusters are over-represented in the customers data, as compared to the general population; those over-represented clusters will be assumed to be part of the core userbase. This information can then be used for further applications, such as targeting for a marketing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off with, load in the demographics data for the general population into a pandas DataFrame, and do the same for the feature attributes summary. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project: they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so you'll need an additional argument in your [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the main dataset, it may take some time for it to load completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the dataset is loaded, it's recommended that you take a little bit of time just browsing the general structure of the dataset and feature summary file. You'll be getting deep into the innards of the cleaning in the first major step of the project, so gaining some general familiarity can help you get your bearings."

    "#### Step 1.1.1: Convert Missing Value Codes to NaNs\n",
    "The fourth column of the feature attributes summary (loaded in above as `feat_info`) documents the codes from the data dictionary that indicate missing or unknown data. While the file encodes this as a list (e.g. `[-1,0]`), this will get read in as a string object. You'll need to do a little bit of parsing to make use of it to identify and clean the data. Convert data that matches a 'missing' or 'unknown' value code into a numpy NaN value. You might want to see how much data takes on a 'missing' or 'unknown' code, and how much data is naturally missing, as a point of interest.\n",

You will want to use matplotlib's [`hist()`](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html) function to visualize the distribution of missing value counts to find these columns. Identify and document these columns. While some of these columns might have justifications for keeping or re-encoding the data, for this project you should just remove them from the dataframe.

    "### Step 1.2: Select and Re-Encode Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking for missing data isn't the only way in which you can prepare a dataset for analysis. Since the unsupervised learning techniques to be used will only work on data that is encoded numerically, you need to make a few encoding changes or additional assumptions to be able to make progress. In addition, while almost all of the values in the dataset are encoded using numbers, not all of them represent numeric values. Check the third column of the feature summary (`feat_info`) for a summary of types of measurement.\n",
    "- For numeric and interval data, these features can be kept without changes.\n",
    "- Most of the variables in the dataset are ordinal in nature. While ordinal values may technically be non-linear in spacing, make the simplifying assumption that the ordinal variables can be treated as being interval in nature (that is, kept without any changes).\n",
    "- Special handling may be necessary for the remaining two variable types: categorical, and 'mixed'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two parts of this sub-step, you will perform an investigation of the categorical and mixed-type features and make a decision on each of them, whether you will keep, drop, or re-encode each. Then, in the last part, you will create a new data frame with only the selected and engineered columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling is often the trickiest part of the data analysis process, and there's a lot of it to be done here. But stick with it: once you're done with this step, you'll be ready to get to the machine learning parts of the project!"

    "- For binary (two-level) categoricals that take numeric values, you can keep them without needing to do anything.\n",
    "- There is one binary variable that takes on non-numeric values. For this one, you need to re-encode the values as numbers or create a dummy variable.\n",
    "- For multi-level categoricals (three or more values), you can choose to encode the values using multiple dummy variables (e.g. via [OneHotEncoder](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)), or (to keep things straightforward) just drop them from the analysis. As always, document your choices in the Discussion section."

While there aren't enough levels to disentangle east from west, you should create two new variables to capture the other two dimensions: an interval-type variable for decade, and a binary variable for movement.\n",

Break up the two-digit codes by their 'tens'-place and 'ones'-place digits into two new ordinal variables (which, for the purposes of this project, is equivalent to just treating them as their raw numeric values).\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we apply dimensionality reduction techniques to the data, we need to perform feature scaling so that the principal component vectors are not influenced by the natural differences in scale for features. Starting from this part of the project, you'll want to keep an eye on the [API reference page for sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html) to help you navigate to all of the classes and functions that you'll need. In this substep, you'll need to check the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sklearn requires that data not have missing values in order for its estimators to work properly. So, before applying the scaler to your data, make sure that you've cleaned the DataFrame of the remaining missing values. This can be as simple as just removing all data points with missing data, or applying an [Imputer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html) to replace all missing values. You might also try a more complicated procedure where you temporarily remove missing values in order to compute the scaling parameters before re-introducing those missing values and applying imputation. Think about how much missing data you have and what possible effects each approach might have on your analysis, and justify your decision in the discussion section below.\n",
    "- For the actual scaling function, a [StandardScaler](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) instance is suggested, scaling each feature to mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n",
    "- For these classes, you can make use of the `.fit_transform()` method to both fit a procedure to the data as well as apply the transformation to the data at the same time. Don't forget to keep the fit sklearn objects handy, since you'll be applying them to the customer demographics data towards the end of the project."
